      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Senior Autopilot Software Engineer at Tesla, focused on developing and fine-tuning end-to-end autonomous
        driving models and reinforcement learning (GRPO) systems for behavior optimization in challenging conditions.
        I hold an Integrated Master’s in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of
        Athens, where I led the Formula Student autonomous racing division. My interests lie at the intersection of 
        machine learning, planning, and control for scalable autonomous systems.

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Senior Autopilot Software Engineer, Tesla</strong> — Palo Alto, CA <span class="date">Aug 2025 – Present</span><br>
          Fine-tuning end-to-end driving models with reinforcement learning (GRPO) to improve behavior in reduced-visibility scenarios.
          Developed lane-change evaluation metrics in an internal video-generation simulator to quantify safety and performance tradeoffs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Autopilot Software Engineer, Tesla</strong> — Palo Alto, CA <span class="date">Feb 2025 – Aug 2025</span><br>
          Adapted the Lane Departure Avoidance feature for rear-wheel-steer dynamics and deployed it on Cybertruck (5-star NCAP prerequisite).
          Built an MPC error-tracker for diagnosing model mismatch between control predictions and SLAM ground truth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Autopilot Software QA Engineer, Tesla</strong> — Palo Alto, CA <span class="date">Jan 2024 – Feb 2025</span><br>
          Led platform-specific validation for the first FSD release on Cybertruck, shipped to ~30,000 vehicles.
          Developed comfort evaluation suites and correlated automated metrics with driver feedback for data-driven deployment gating.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Head of Autonomous Driving Software, PROM Racing NTUA (FSAE)</strong> — Athens, Greece <span class="date">Oct 2021 – Aug 2023</span><br>
          Founded and led a 10-member team to develop an autonomous race car. Implemented YOLOv5- and ResNet-based perception,
          designed an EKF for vehicle state estimation, built a graph-based SLAM system with iSAM, and validated a Model Predictive Controller for path tracking.
        </li>
