      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I am Ares Koumblis (Greek: Άρης Κουμπλής), a Senior Autopilot Software Engineer at Tesla, working on the 
        evaluation and reinforcement learning fine-tuning of end-to-end autonomous driving models. I hold a BE/ME in 
        Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, with a concentration in 
        Computer Science. While there, I founded and led the Formula Student (FSAE) autonomous driving team within 
        <a href="https://promracingteam.com/" target="_blank">PROM Racing NTUA</a>. My thesis focused on the autonomous 
        driving pipeline deployed on the team's first driverless car, advised by 
        <a href="https://robotics.ntua.gr/members/ktzaf/" target="_blank">Prof. Constantinos Tzafestas</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience, from engineering a camera-only autonomous stack for an FSAE race car to adapting and fine-tuning 
        control policies for Tesla’s production vehicles, has been shaped by confronting the limits of autonomy at scale. 
        I learned that reliance on manually engineered logic and heuristics makes systems brittle in unpredictable environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        These experiences drive my interest in scalable robot learning. I aim to develop generalist agents that can adapt 
        quickly to new tasks and operate safely in previously unseen conditions. I am particularly interested in learning 
        representations and algorithms that unify perception, control, and reasoning, moving beyond data imitation to create 
        adaptive, interpretable, and robust autonomous systems.
